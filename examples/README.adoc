= Create some backends

The following instructions set up some echo servers as a "backend",
with a DNS server pointing to them.

[source, bash]
----
# Install a working, out-of-the-box, DNS server
cargo install hickory-dns

# Start some echo servers
cargo run --example tcp_echo_server [::1]:6001
cargo run --example tcp_echo_server [::1]:6002
cargo run --example tcp_echo_server [::1]:6003

# Update 'examples/dns_server/test.com.zone' to reference the echo server
# which was just created.
#
# By default, it references the addresses / ports in the comment above.

# Start a DNS server, referencing the echo server
hickory-dns -c examples/dns_server/config.toml -z examples/dns_server -p 1234

# Confirm your DNS server is working
dig -6 @::1 -p 1234  _echo._tcp.test.com -t SRV
----

= Run a Connection Pool

Once you've set up the backends and a DNS server, it's possible to run
a connection pool client (and workload generator) that reaches out to those backends.

[source,bash]
----
# Run a connection pool, which uses the DNS server to find the echo servers.
cargo run --example tcp_echo_workload --features qtop
----

The "--features qtop" flag is optional, but it allows us to inspect the
connection pooling with "qtop", a tool for inspecting connection pool state.

[source,bash]
----
# Run this command while the "tcp_echo_workload" is running.
cargo run --bin qtop "ws://127.0.0.1:42069/qtop/stats"
----
