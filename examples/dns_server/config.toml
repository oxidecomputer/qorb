##
## This is an example configuration file for the Hickory DNS named server.
##
## The format is in TOML: https://github.com/toml-lang/toml which was chosen
##  as the configuration format for Hickory DNS. While Hickory DNS is intended to
##  be a drop-in replacement for BIND9, it will not support the named.conf files
##  directly. At some point, there will be a binary tool for converting the
##  BIND9 configuration files over to Hickory DNS TOML.
##
## Many of these options are available as both command line options and
##  configuration options in these files. In that case, the command line option
##  will take precedence.
##
## Comments with two hash marks, ##, document the config parameter
## Comments with one hash mark, #, is an example line and should be the default
##
## The root options are similar to the options in 'options { .. }' in named.conf

## listen_addrs: address on which to listen for incoming connections
##  this can be a list of ipv4 or ipv6 addresses
# listen_addrs_ipv4 = ["0.0.0.0"]
listen_addrs_ipv6 = ["::1"]

## listen_port: port on which to list, default 53
# listen_port = 53

[[zones]]
zone = "test.com"
zone_type = "Primary"
file = "test.com.zone"

## if false, updates will not be allowed, default false
# allow_update = false
