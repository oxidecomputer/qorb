= Qorb

Qorb is a work-in-progress Connection Pooling library, heavily inspired by
the "Cueball" connection pooling library.

It is not yet functional, but this space will be updated when it's ready for usage.

== TODO List

Things I'd like to do before getting more eyes on this:

* Add dtrace probes
* Add a baseline test suite
